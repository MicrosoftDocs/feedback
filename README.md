## Questions

If you want to know something about [docs.microsoft.com](https://docs.microsoft.com), you can open an issue with `[Question]` at the start of the title to mark something as a question and not a suggestion to change/add functionality. Or you can [reach out to us on Twitter](https://twitter.com/docsmsft).

## FAQ

### I've already submitted my idea on UserVoice before. Is it gone?

If your idea was not marked as **Completed** or **Declined** on the docs.microsoft.com UserVoice site, it is migrated over to the GitHub issue tracker in this repo. You can comment on the suggestion and we will properly attribute it to you with a link to your GitHub profile.

### How quickly will you implement my suggestion?

Timeframes vary and we are unable to directly commit to any specific deadline after submission. That said, we will update the idea with the appropriate status once we have more details.

### Previously I could upvote ideas. How do I show support now?

You can take advantage of GitHub reactions. Simply open the issue, and add a reaction.

The added benefit to this is we also see how many people don't like a feature, compared to those that want it implemented - this allows us to design better functionality.
